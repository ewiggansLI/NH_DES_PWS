Code for compiling New Hampshire's approximated PWS boundaries for ingestion into Geoconnex

The Python code was used to aggregate buffered water and sewer service lines that are not publicly available and that IoW is not able to publcly share.
As such, this is an approximation of PWS areas based on those buffers, based on the 'ok' from Chris Dunbar, at NH Dept of Environmental Services.

The parcels that are displayed represent areas that intersect with the water/sewer bufered lines.
The output file will be publicly shared and is found at: <insert link to geojson>
